Crop Yield Prediction Project
This repository contains the complete Crop Yield Prediction Project, developed as part of a summative assignment. The project combines Linear regression model development, FastAPI development, and mobile app implementation to predict crop yields based on environmental and agricultural factors.

Project Overview
Task 1: Linear Regression Model Development

Built and optimized machine learning models to predict crop yield using the Crop Yield Prediction Dataset from Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrigaankjaswal/crop-yield-prediction-dataset/data
Compared Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest algorithms to select the best model.
Google collab of notebook: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1AXeDtGu2T0aw0SwvLJK44nELWdK6eSSg?usp=sharing Read more on it in the READMe inside its directory
Task 2: FastAPI Development

Developed a FastAPI for making predictions using the trained model.
Implemented input validation with Pydantic and tested the API using Swagger UI.
Deployed the API on Render. https://fastapi-rm5x.onrender.com/docs Read more on it in the READMe inside its directory
Task 3: Mobile App Development

Developed a Flutter mobile app that connects to the FastAPI and makes crop yield predictions.
